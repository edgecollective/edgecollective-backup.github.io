        <h1>Remote Soil Moisture Monitoring</h1>
        
    <hr>
<p><em>June 25, 2019</em></p>
<h2>Project Goals</h2>
<p>An Edge Collective client was looking to establish some baseline soil measurements around tree planting sites in order to begin to assess the impact of regenerative agriculture practices there; specifically, the impact of biochar on soil moisture.</p>
<p>We're planning on beginning by creating two instrumentation setups, one at each measurement site (“biochar” and “non-biochar”).  Each setup will operate on 12V battery power, and measure soil moisture and temperature locally every 30 minutes.  One of the setups (“Remote Node”, Fig 1) will send its data to a “Gateway Node” via LoRa radio; and the “Gateway Node” will then send the combined datasets to FarmOS via cellular modem. We will be using HOBO / Decagon Soil Moisture probes as our sensors.</p>

<h2>Cellular Posting to FarmOS</h2>
<p><em>-- June 26, 2019, 18.00 --</em></p>
<p>We'll begin by setting up a quick 'end-to-end' test system for transmitting data from a Quahog to FarmOS via a cellular modem (the Adafruit FONA cellular module).</p>
<p>Because the FONA can only use TSL 1.0, and FarmOS is setup to require higher than TSL 1.0 to POST, we'll be using a 'relay server' -- a very simple NodeJS script, <a href="https://github.com/edgecollective/farmos-relay">farmos-relay</a>, that receives POSTs from the FONA (accepting TSL 1.0) and then re-broadcasts to FarmOS.  (Note: we should look into the security of doing things this way.)</p>
<img src="/img/field_1/prototype_1.jpeg">
<p><em>-- Update, 18:55 --</em></p>
<p>I've reproduced the Quahog FONA code so that it posts to FarmOS via the above relay script.  The micropython script is <a href="git@github.com:edgecollective/knuth-soil-remote.git">relay.py</a>.</p>
<p>I've also got a Feather M0 LoRa running CircuitPython posting every second to the Quahog via LoRa; that code is called <a href="https://github.com/edgecollective/knuth-soil-remote/blob/master/feather/rad_alice.py">rad_alice.py</a></p>
<p>Next, to hook these up together so that the Feather is posting (fake, at this point, until I hook up the sensors) data to the Quahog, and then that data is posted to FarmOS.  If I can get that running, I'll run it overnight at 30 minute intervals.  It'd be nice to include a 1-wire sensor, or equivalent, if possible so that temperature data were collected. I'll see how far I can get ...</p>
<p><em>-- Update, 19:15 --</em></p>
<p>To make things easier, I'm rewriting the Feather LoRa code so that it'll just post (test) data once on boot, after two seconds.  That code is <a href="https://github.com/edgecollective/knuth-soil-remote/blob/master/feather/rad_alice.py">here</a>.  That way when I want to test the remote --&gt; gateway system, I can just press the &quot;Reset&quot; button the Feather, and after two seconds it'll send some test data through the system.  At this point it's just CSV format data; in the future I'll try to send JSON and parse it on the other end.</p>
<p><em>-- Update, 19:43 --</em></p>
<p>I've got the Quahog receiving the Feather data via LoRa, and printing it out on the OLED, with this commit of <a href="https://github.com/edgecollective/knuth-soil-remote/blob/5767ee35aad9d368e93ba1d583416a532b8b608b/quahog/rad_relay.py">rad_relay.py</a> Micropython code on the Quahog.</p>
<p><em>-- Update, 20:06 --</em></p>
<p>Cool! We've got the end-to-end demo (with faked data) now!</p>

<p>TODO:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting some temp data posted. I'll implement OneWire on the Feather side for this.</li>
<li>Detecting the network status of the FONA and waiting until it's connected to attempt to post.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>-- Update, 20:39 --</em></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/edgecollective/knuth-soil-remote/blob/master/feather/rad_onewire.py">rad_onewire.py</a> on the Feather will measure temp every interval, and post via LoRa ...</p>
<p><em>-- Update, 21.:01 --</em></p>
<p>Alright, looks like we're consistently posting -- with real temp data!  The latest code is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feather: <a href="https://github.com/edgecollective/knuth-soil-remote/blob/master/feather/rad_onewire.py">rad_onewire.py</a> (copied as main.py onto the Feather so that it runs on boot)</li>
<li>Quahog: <a href="https://github.com/edgecollective/knuth-soil-remote/blob/master/quahog/rad_relay.py">rad_relay.py</a></li>
<li>FarmOS data: <a href="https://wolfesneck.farmos.net/farm/sensor/knuthtestone">test data</a> at the Wolfesneck FarmOS instance.</li>
</ul>
<img src="/img/field_1/temp_1.png">
<p>Still have the remaining todo:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detecting the network status of the FONA and waiting until it's connected to attempt to post.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>-- June 27, 2019, 10:20 --</em></p>
<p>The cellular modem system has been running overnight without a hitch, posting temperature data every two minutes to FarmOS!  I downloaded a csv file from FarmOS.  Because the format is:</p>
<pre><code>timestamp 1, key1, value1
timestamp 1, key2, value2
timestamp 2, key1, value1
tiemstamp 2, key2, value2
</code></pre>
<p>I used a little script I found online to remove every other line (so that I could focus on temp data only and graph it easily):</p>
<pre><code>sed -e n\;d &lt;file
</code></pre>
<p>Worked nicely.  Plot of the resultant data (using LibreOffice) is here:</p>
<img src="/img/field_1/plot_overnight.png">
<p><strong>Cellular network status</strong>. I saw some notes online that the network status of the SIM800 module (on which the Fona is based) isn't particularly revealing about the actual network status.  I'll at least try to assess its status, but not sure yet whether it makes sense to write any logic around it; it might be better to just attempt to send, and then if fail, go back to sleep -- rather than wasting battery on re-attempts.  Perhaps the network status <em>is</em> reliable upon wakeup -- when it first transitions from &quot;not available&quot; to &quot;available&quot; -- in which case we can at least keep attempting to post before a TIMEOUT is reached.</p>
<p><strong>Power</strong>. The next big step is to think about the optimal way to do battery power.  The complication is that the FONA module really wants a 3.7V rechargeable battery input.  What this might mean is that the rest of the system ought to get designed around that; or (less elegantly), that we have a separate charging system for the 3.7V battery, and then another one for the Quahog + sensor.  The sensor will likely require 3.6 - 12V.  The Quahog's 3.3V regulator requires 4.7V input, and its 5V regulator requires over 6V, I believe.  Other than these voltage considerations, I believe the circuit for turning the entire system on and off is well-designed at this point; it's really just a matter of figuring out how to generate the required voltages nicely and simply.</p>
<p><em>-- Update 10:57 --</em></p>
<p>Okay, this might be a 'simple' solution:  If I use a 5xAA battery pack, I get 5x1.5 volts = 7.5V input to the Quahog. This means that both the 3.3V and the 5V regulators on the Quahog will be happy.  The 5V regulator output can then be used to recharge the 3.7V battery on the FONA (which has an onboard charger circuit).  The question is whether I'll be charging it rapidly enough while the system is on to counteract the depletion due to FONA usage.</p>
<p>So a next step (which is necessary ultimately anyway) is to transmit the FONA battery voltage. I'll work on that today.  That way we'll be able to check how we're doing on keeping that battery charged.  Then power otherwise isn't as complicated.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.electroschematics.com/13548/introducingsim800l/">Nice reference</a> for the SIM800 module.</p>
<p>And here's a link to the <a href="https://www.elecrow.com/wiki/images/2/20/SIM800_Series_AT_Command_Manual_V1.09.pdf">SIM800 manual</a>.</p>
<p>Specific information about the SIM800 battery command <a href="https://m2msupport.net/m2msupport/atcbc-battery-charge/">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>-- Update 11:41 --</em></p>
<p>Okay!  Was able to capture the cellular battery voltage using a function I slapped together, and made a new version of the Quahog code: <a href="https://github.com/edgecollective/knuth-soil-remote/blob/master/quahog/rad_relay_batt.py">rad_relay_batt.py</a>.</p>
<p>I realized in the process that the &quot;relay server&quot; is currently &quot;hard-coded&quot; to accept and relay only two parameters: temp and soil moisture.  So for this test, I'm just going to stuff the battery voltage into the moisture variable -- this will allow me to track the voltage values over time for a few hours.  Meanwhile, I'll work on making the relay server on mosspig.club more generic if I can (perhaps making the cellular code into HTTP POST).  And I'l also work on the power circuit.</p>
